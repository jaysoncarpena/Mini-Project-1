        <p>Become your team’s most explosive scorer by mastering your ball-handling and finishing moves following the TrainForHoops basketball training program.</p>
        <p>We’ll give you a step-by-step training program that focuses on drills that mimic game moves in order for you to get better and see real results faster. You’ll develop:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Ball-handling to get you where you need to be on the court (prime scoring position or making the defense collapse on you so that your teammate has an open shot).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Scoring moves to make getting buckets easy (1 to 3 dribbles to score points within your team’s offensive plays).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Passing to make sure your teammates get the ball in their shot pocket to increase the speed and accuracy of their shots.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>What that means is no more sitting in a gym for 2 plus hours doing the cliche 500 stationary shots per day and not seeing the results you want and need in real games.
        </p>
        <p>If you decide you like what we’re offering, you’ll get the training system where we give you the step-by-step 90 minute workouts designed to specifically push you past your comfort zone to take your game to the next level.
        </p>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">This basketball training isn’t for everyone.</span> Why? Because it requires consistently putting in the work. We can give you the information, but you have to put the work in. For those players willing to follow the program and put in the work, they’ve experienced tremendous improvements to their game.

        <p class="fw-bold">The Opportunity</p>
        <p>Do you ever feel that no matter how long you train, you just aren’t getting any better? Tired of seeing other players outperform you and get all the shine and recognition? When it comes to improving your game, serious players are pretty much on their own to figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>The drills you do in practice with your team just aren’t enough for you to see the gains you’re trying to make. It’s incredibly frustrating to put in 2 hours or more at the gym for weeks and not see any noticeable improvements to your skills and in-game performance.
        </p>
        <p>It doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
        <p>As a player, your goal is not to design a training program for yourself. Honestly, it’s a waste of your time. All you need to do is find a basketball training program that focuses on training the skills you’ll be using in a real game and do the program.
        </p>
        <p>I believe our training program will enable you to do this… only if you put in the work and complete it.</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">How We Train</p>
        <p>Essentially, it works this way:</p>
        <p>Training manuals and DVDs are pretty good, but people only follow them for a short period of time, if at all, and it always ends in failure. Reason: it’s too much information at once. We do things very differently here. The training program is built out one very small piece at a time, introducing a brand new part only once every 2-3 weeks. That way, in 3 months time, everything will come so naturally to you that you can do it without thinking; it’ll be second nature to you and you’ll just react to the opportunities during real games.</p>
        <p>So get started by following our training program below. We no longer charge for our program because we want as many players as possible to reach their full potential, but that doesn’t mean it’s free.</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">The price you’ll have to pay is hard work, commitment, and consistently doing the workouts.</p>
        <p>Each workout represents one week’s worth of training and you have access to 24 weeks of training. Click on the links below to get started:</p>

        <p class="fw-bold">Guarantee</p>
        <p>My belief is this: if you invest in professional coaching and training – and you consistently do the program – you should start seeing the results you want. Apparently this is a revolutionary idea.</p>
        <p>I’m very confident in what we do at TrainForHoops. Specifically, here’s how it works. <span class="fw-bold">If you do the program, you become a better player, and start reaching many of your goals.</span></p>
